 Customer Analysis: Top customers by purchase amount

 Category Insights: Quantity sold by product category and sub-category

 Payment Mode: Preferred payment methods across orders

 Time Analysis: Profit trends across months and quarters

### Problems Identified
States with Negative or Low Profits:- Multiple states, including Jammu & Kashmir, Bihar, and Jharkhand, have reported negative or very low profits in certain quarters. For example, Jammu & Kashmir recorded a ₹183 loss in Q3, highlighting inefficiencies such as high return rates, operational issues, or unprofitable pricing strategies.

Uneven Profitability Despite Similar Sales:- States like Andhra Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir show comparable sales volumes but very different profitability levels. This disparity indicates the need for region-specific cost management, pricing strategy, and customer behavior analysis.

Skewed Category Performance:- The Clothing category dominates across nearly all states, contributing to over 50% of the total quantity sold. This shows a lack of product variety in customer preferences or marketing focus, making the business vulnerable to fluctuations in a single category.

Sub-Category Losses:- Sub-categories such as ‘Saree’ have consistently reported negative profits across various states and quarters, likely due to high return rates, deep discounting, or inventory issues.

Heavy Dependence on COD (Cash on Delivery):- COD is the most used payment method in many states, sometimes reaching 88% usage share, which may be driving higher product return rates and increasing operational costs.

Time-Based Profitability Fluctuations:- Across different states, Q3 consistently shows lower or negative profits, particularly in September, signaling possible seasonal issues, supply chain inefficiencies, or promotion-driven low-margin sales during this period.

### Suggestions & Recommendations
Revise Pricing & Return Policies: Especially for Sarees and other loss-leading sub-categories.

Promote Digital Payments: Reduce reliance on COD by offering discounts or incentives for UPI/Credit/Debit card users.

Optimize Logistics in Q3 Regions: Conduct root cause analysis in Jammu & Kashmir to resolve loss-making operations.

Balanced Category Promotion: Run targeted marketing for Electronics and Furniture to diversify product demand.

Customer Segmentation: Identify high-value customers like Krutika, Pinky, and Asish for loyalty programs or upselling.
